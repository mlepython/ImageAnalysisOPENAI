Will need to use a guess approach to find a possible factor. When a factor is found, we can use long division to determine the quotient. Then we can factor the quotient to get our polynomial and fully factored form.\nFor example #3, He is a degree four problem, but the process is the same. Need to find factors of the constant term. Using a guest approach to find a factor and then use long division to find the quotient. The quotient will be a cubic function that will need to be factored. The factoring process is the same. We can guess another factor and then perform the long division and then factor the quotients.\nFor the next question, have the students try it on their own. Circulate the classroom and check in with students to see how they are doing.\nPart 2: Determine a factored form of a polynomial when the leading coefficient is not 1 is not. One will need to use the rational 0 theorem. There will be a factor of ax-b in the polynomial, b is a factor of the constant term, and a is a factor of the leading coefficient. Need to find factors of b/a\nThe process we're factoring a polynomial when the leading coefficient is not one. It is very similar to part one. We will need to find the possible factors of the constant term and possible factors of the leading coefficient. Some students might find this part little difficult, but work through slowly with them. When all possible factors are found, we can use a guess and check approach to find a factor, then use long division To find the quotient.\nHave students attempt the next two problems on their own. Circulate the classroom and checking the students to see how they are doing.\nPart 3: Other factoring strategies\nAnother strategy to factor is factor by grouping. This strategy involves grouping the first two terms and last terms together and then looking for a common binomial. This method is a lot faster than using long division, but doesn't always work.\nHave students try the last three problems on their own. The very last problem.

First we need to determine a function for volume that depends on the variable x. For all application problems, there will be some sort of domain restriction on the variable. When dealing with volume, the height, length, and width must all be positive quantities. So we will need to check for the domain restrictions on each of these expressions for the three dimensions.

Give a graph of a polynomial function of degree through your higher and asked the students to determine on what intervals the graph will be less than zero and greater than zero. Students should easily be able to identify positive and negative intervals. For the next question, they will need to factor the polynomials first before they can solve the inequality. There are two methods to solve the inequality, using the graph or using a table of intervals. The table of intervals requires them to use the X intercepts to separate the table into different intervals. Then use a test point in each interval to check to see if the function will be positive or negative. Have them attempt the last two questions on the room.
